Store info about batches of food.

It will give unchangable track of the origin of the product, as well as the trail it takes it reaches the consumer of the store.

Tomatoe sauce example - producer wants to share information about specific tomatoe GMO identifiers with the supliers.
But they want to keep it secret from other producers since it might be a business secret.

We will enable adding secrets with a passphrase, only those who know the passphrase will be able to read the secret, thus, every
part of the supply chain can choose who they wanna share their passphrase with.

3 different scenarios:
- for each new batch we will add new contract to the chain - abandon contract at the end of the chain.
- write info to the contract (location and secrets)
- reading info about the product batch (reading secrets with the right passphrase)
